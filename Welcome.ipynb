    "## What is This?\n",
    "In this tutorial you will learn how to open, edit, publish and share a course in the Jupyter Lab environment, in order to create a Jupyter Book for your course.<br>\n",

    "## 1. Course Structure\n",
    "A Jupytre Book is an open-source tool used for creating interactive, web-based books and documents from computational notebooks. It allows authors to combine text, code, mathematical equations, visualizations, and other multimedia content into a cohesive narrative that can be easily shared and published online. \n",
    "### This is the basic structure of a Book:\n",
    "- #### Book Directory:\n",
    "This is the main directory (found at the left of the screeen) containing all the files and folders related to your course Book.\n",
    "- #### Chapters and Sections:\n",
    "Each chapter of your book typically corresponds to a Jupyter notebook file (`.ipynb`) or a Markdown file (`.md`). These files contain the actual content of your book, including text, code, and visualizations.\n",
    "- #### Table of Contents (toc.yml):\n",
    "A `.yml` file that defines the structure of your book, including chapters, sections, and subsections. It serves as the roadmap for navigating through your book.\n",
    "- #### Configuration Files:\n",
    "These files define various settings and options for your book, such as theme customization, plugins, and metadata. Common configuration files include _config.yml for general settings and _toc.yml for customizing the table of contents.\n",
    "- #### Output Files:\n",
    "When you build your book (We will exaplin later how), Jupyter Book generates HTML pages and other output formats (e.g., PDF, ePub) based on your content and configuration. These output files are stored in a the `_build` directory at the top of the topics to the left.\n",
    "- #### Scripts:\n",
    "Building, publishing and uploading your Book to the web might seem tricky at first. To make things easier we creates several scripts with indicative names that do the work for you. These scripts can be found in the `scripts` directory."
