    "# Tutorial\n",
    "Welcome! This template is a guide for creating a new course at Tel Aviv University, the Faculty of Exact Sciences, using the Jupyter Book library.

File with the suffix `.yml` are settings and configuration files. The most important ones are `_toc.yml` which defines the structure of your course and `_config.yml` for general settings."
